A performance by a Filipino artist was delivered as part of an online collaboration, and it was rendered as digital pictures that moved like a person but lost the body’s unique texture. On the other hand, “We are linked” begins with the ludicrous question, “Can digital images wear textures and enter the real world?” while looking at digital photos, that is, bodily images translated into data. The primary character of the video is a mouse [[cursor]], a digital emblem, who wishes he could transform into a hand in the real world. Cursors serve the same function as hands in virtual space as they do in the real world, which includes the ability to choose and make decisions. The hand and cursor appear to be entirely linked at the beginning of the film; however, as we all know, the cursor is not a hand and can never be the hand itself. The plot concludes with an event that was entirely caused by the cursor’s delusion.
