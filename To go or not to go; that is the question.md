This project talks about the importance of subjectivity and discernment rather than being blindly led by developing technology, and consists of scenarios, videos, and wall image works. It is an epic work that ironically expresses that we should have [[Subjectivity]] in virtual space in a flood of information, **bringing ‘[[Cursor]]’, who performs our work instead of humans, as the main character.** As a virtual subject that directly performs human needs in a virtual space, the cursor has the property of an avatar and is a substance that approaches the latest technology in virtual reality with concerns and expectations. On a sunny day, the cursor in the scenario becomes conscious in Jisoo’s laptop and starts with an ontological question. It is a story that follows that a cursor dreaming of the finiteness of death in an infinite virtual world struggles to cross into the physical world, but contrary to his thoughts, he finds himself printed inanimate objects through a 3D printer. The video shows the opening part from the traditional interview method to the AI program in a fake documentary as if it were a collage.
